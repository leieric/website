I am a senior undergraduate student at Cornell University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and minoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I currently work with [Prof. Christoph Studer](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/christoph-studer) in the [VLSI Information Processing Group](http://vip.ece.cornell.edu). I will start my Ph.D. at Penn in fall 2020.
