I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department. I received my B.S. from Cornell University in May 2020, where I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. At Cornell, I worked with [Prof. Christoph Studer](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/christoph-studer) in the [VLSI Information Processing Group](http://vip.ece.cornell.edu).
